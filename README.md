# Portafolio

My portfolio consists of a variety of projects that demonstrate my proficiency in Python, HTML, and SQL. Some of my most notable projects include "Mission to Mars", where I utilized Python to build a data analytics tool that was able to predict trends and patterns in data sets. Additionally, "Surfs Up" showcases my proficiency in SQLite and Flask, where I created an analysis on the weather for a local business.

Through these projects, I have gained a strong understanding of the development process, from ideation and planning to execution and maintenance. I have also honed my skills in problem-solving, debugging, and optimization, allowing me to create effective and efficient solutions.

This **Portafolio** is a draft.
