# Portafolio

Here, you can find the documents for the deploy, it is very importan to mantain the same order for the correct run:

1. index.html
2. assets (folder):
   + app.css
   + app.js
   + images (folder)

## Remember
To build a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we need to create at least three files:

1. An **HTML file** to structure the content of the web page. This file will have the extension ".html". This file is the main file for the web page, which contains the **structure** and **content** of the page.

2. A **CSS file** to style the HTML elements of the web page. This file will have the extension ".css". This file contains the **styles** and **layout** for the HTML elements on the web page.

3. A **JavaScript file** to add dynamic behavior to the web page. This file will have the extension ".js". This file contains the JavaScript code that adds **dynamic functionality** to the web page.

## Example: Link the files

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My Web Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your HTML content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

In the example code, the CSS file is linked using the ** '<link>' tag** with the **'rel=' attribute** set to **"stylesheet"** and the **'href' attribute** set to **"styles.css"**. The JavaScript file is linked using the **'<script>' tag** with the **'src=' attribute** set to **"script.js"**.

** In my **Portafolio** my files are named index.html, app.css (the **'rel=' and 'href=' attributes**) and app.js (the **'src=' attribute**).
